# ND Core

## Compatibility
ND Core is build to work with ox inventory and supports all features.

## Installation
- Install [ND_Core](https://github.com/ND-Framework/ND_Core/releases)
- Modify your `server.cfg`, starting ox_inventory immediately after ND_Core.

```yaml
start oxmysql
start ox_lib
start ND_Core
start ox_inventory
```

## Create vehicle keys item
If you use `setr core:useInventoryForKeys true` in [`ndcore.cfg`](https://ndcore.dev/setup#configuration) then you need to create the vehicle key item in `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`.

```lua
["keys"] = {
    label = "Car keys",
    weight = 50,
    stack = false,
    close = true,
    allowArmed = true,
    server = {
        export = "ND_Core.keys"
    },
    buttons = {
        {
            label = "Trunk",
            action = function(slot)
                exports["ND_Core"]:keyControl("trunk", slot)
            end
        },
        {
            label = "Disable key",
            action = function(slot)
                exports["ND_Core"]:keyControl("disable", slot)
            end
        }
    }
},
```


## Create lockpick & tools items
Lockpicks are used to get into locked vehicles, tools are used to hotwire vehicles add these items to `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`.

```lua
["lockpick"] = {
    label = "Lockpick",
    weight = 160,
    consume = 1,
    stack = true,
    close = true,
    client = {
        export = "ND_Core.lockpick"
    }
},
["tools"] = {
    label = "Tools",
    description = "Can be used to hotwire vehicles.",
    weight = 800,
    consume = 1,
    stack = true,
    close = true,
    client = {
        export = "ND_Core.hotwire"
    }
},
```
